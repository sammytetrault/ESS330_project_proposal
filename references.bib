    abstract = {In 2016, the Denver Metro Area (DMA)/Northern Colorado Front Range (NCFR) was reclassified from a Marginal to a Moderate O3 Non-Attainment Area due to the prevalence of high summer ozone (O3) occurrences. Hourly surface O3 data collected during 2000–2015 from a total of 80 monitoring sites in the State of Colorado were investigated for geographical features in O3 behavior and O3 changes over time. We particularly focus on summer O3 (June, July, August), which is the time when most exceedances of the O3 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) have been recorded. Variables investigated include the statistical (5th, 50th (median), and 95th percentile) distribution of O3 mixing ratios, diurnal amplitudes, and their trends. Trend analyses were conducted for 20 site records that had at least ten years of data. The majority of Colorado ozone monitoring sites show an increase of the 5th (16 total; 11 of these are statistically significant (p-value ≤ 0.05) trends) and 50th (15 total; 4 statistically significant trends) percentile values. Changes for the 95th percentile values were smaller and less consistent. One site showed a statistically significant declining trend, and one site an increasing trend; the majority of other sites had slightly negative, albeit not statistically significant declining O3. Ozone changes at the two highest elevations sites (\&gt;2500 m asl) are all negative, contrasting increasing O3 at U.S. West Coast sites. NCFR urban sites do not show the rate of decreasing higher percentile O3 as seen for the majority of urban areas across the U.S. during the past 1–2 decades. The amplitudes of diurnal O3 cycles were studied as a proxy for nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and the diurnal O3 production chemistry. The majority of sites show a decrease in the median summer O3 diurnal amplitude (19 total/10 statistically significant). This is mostly driven by the increase in nighttime O3 minima, which is most likely a sign for a declining rate of nighttime O3 loss from titration with nitric oxide (NO), indicating a change in O3 behavior from declining NOx emissions. Since median and upper percentile surface O3 values in the DMA have not declined at the rates seen in other western U.S. regions, thus far the reduction in NOx has had a more pronounced effect on the lower percentile O3 distribution than on high O3 occurrences that primarily determine air quality. An assessment of the influence of oil and gas emissions on Colorado, and in particular DMA O3, is hampered by the sparsity of monitoring within oil and gas basins. Continuous, long-term, high quality, and co-located O3, NOx, and VOC monitoring are recommended for elucidating the geographical heterogeneity of O3 precursors, their changing emissions, and for evaluation of the effectiveness of O3 air quality regulations.},

abstract = {Lake Erie has the longest history of colonization by both Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis in North America and is therefore optimal for the study of long-term dynamics of dreissenid species. In addition, the morphometry of Lake Erie basins varies dramatically from the shallow western to the deep eastern basin, making this waterbody a convenient model to investigate patterns of Dreissena distribution, as well as interspecies interactions among dreissenids. We compare our data on the distribution, density and wet biomass of both dreissenid species in Lake Erie collected in 2009 and 2011–2012 with previous data. We found that Dreissena spp. distribution in Lake Erie varied depending on the time since the initial invasion, collection depth, and lake basin. In 2009–2012, zebra mussels were smaller than in 1992 and were consistently smaller than quagga mussels. During 2009–2012, quagga mussels were found at all depths and in all basins, while zebra mussels were common in the western basin only, and in the central and eastern basins were limited to shallow depths, resulting in an almost complete replacement of D. polymorpha with D. rostriformis bugensis. In the shallowest western basin of Lake Erie, zebra mussels represented >30% of the combined dreissenid density even after more than 20years of coexistence, providing strong evidence that, even in lakes as large as Lake Erie (or at least its western basin), D. polymorpha may sustain a significant presence for decades without being displaced by quagga mussels.}

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the historical loss and current shoreline habitat rehabilitation efforts along the urban-industrial Detroit River using geographical information system methods and a shoreline survey. This study found a 97% loss of historical coastal wetlands to human development. By 1985, 55% of the U.S. mainland shoreline had been hardened with steel sheet piling or concrete breakwater that provide limited habitat. Since 1995, 19 projects were implemented, improving 4.93 km of shoreline habitat. A comparison of the 1985 and 2015 georeferenced aerial imagery showed that 2.32 km of soft shoreline was also converted to hard shoreline during this timeframe. Of the 19 projects surveyed, 11 representing 3.35 km made habitat improvements to shoreline that was already georeferenced as “soft“, three representing 360 m converted shoreline from “hard” to “soft”, and five representing 1.22 km added incidental habitat to hardened shoreline. Even with the addition of 1.58 km of new soft shoreline and incidental habitat, there was an overall net loss of 0.74 km of soft shoreline over the 30-year timeframe. To reach the “good” state of at least 70% soft shoreline, an additional 12.1 km of soft shoreline will have to be added. This confirms that shoreline hardening continues despite the best efforts of resource managers and conservation organizations. Resource managers must become opportunistic and get involved up front in urban waterfront redevelopment projects to advocate for habitat. Incremental progress will undoubtedly be slow following adaptive management.},

abstract = {Rapid urban population growth in the cities of South Western United States has led to significant modifications in its environment at local and regional scales. In this study, three densely populated cities in Colorado River Basin (CRB), viz. Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Denver are selected to capture the various dimensions of the impacts of land use changes on emergent hydroclimatic patterns in the entire CRB. We hypothesize that different modes of urban growth will lead to markedly different modification of the thermal environment as well as surface energy balance. To test the hypothesis, we adopted the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting model, incorporating the latest urban modeling system, for regional climate simulations. Projected future urban growth in the period 2010–2100 was obtained from Integrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The simulations of urban growth in CRB demonstrated significant nocturnal warming of about 0.36 °C, 1.07 °C, and 0.94 °C in near-surface temperatures in Phoenix, Denver, and Las Vegas respectively, with comparatively insignificant changes in daytime temperature. In addition, it was found that the thermal environment of Denver is the most susceptible to the projected future urban growth. Responses in urban surface energy budgets also differ in three cities due to the combined effect of local climatology and mode of urban growth.}
